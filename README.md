## Overview

The new NPCs introduced in the Enhanced Editions differ somewhat from the original cast and might not be everyone's taste. This mod provides a number of options to adapt them to your comfort level. You can make their first appearance more passive, giving you more control over whether or when to make the first contact. A small number of events will be slightly altered to make this possible.

Alternatively it is also possible to simply remove one or more NPCs from the game. In that case you have the choice to make their personal or quest-related items available to everyone in stores or as loot.

Additional components allow you to improve their portraits or customize their classes and/or kits to whatever you desire. You can find more detailed information below.
