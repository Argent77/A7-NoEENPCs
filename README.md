## Overview

The new NPCs introduced in the Enhanced Editions differ somewhat from the original cast and might not be everyone's taste. This mod provides a number of options to adapt them to your comfort level. You can make their first appearance more passive, giving you more control over whether or when to make the first contact. A small number of events will be slightly altered to make this possible.

Alternatively it is also possible to simply remove one or more NPCs from the game. In that case you have the choice to make their personal or quest-related items available to everyone in stores or as loot.

Additional components allow you to improve their portraits or customize their classes and/or kits to whatever you desire. You can find more detailed information below.

  - **Make Neera passive *(BG:EE, BG2:EE and EET)*:** In BG:EE this component prevents Neera from initiating a conversation on her own. In BG2:EE this component triggers the introduction cutscene in the Bridge District only when you talk to Neera. She can be found near the place where the Red Wizards cutscene occurs after the townsfolk talked about the local murders.

- **Modify individually: Rasaad**
  - **Disable Rasaad *(BG:EE, BG:SOD, BG2:EE and EET)*:** This component prevents Rasaad from appearing in BG:EE, BG:SOD and BG2:EE.

- **Make NPC-specific items available for everyone:** This component allows you to acquire personal or quest-related items of disabled NPC(s) from merchants all over the game or as loot from containers or creatures. It is only available if you select to disable all or individual NPCs.

- **Allied Caelar Argent in Avernus boss battle *(BG:SOD and EET)*:** This component allows you to control Caelar Argent if she joins the battle as an ally. The following options allow you to refine her behavior even further:
  - **Joins as controllable follower if no free party slots available:** Retains the original behavior of the game by letting Caelar Argent join as a regular party member if a free slot is available.
  - **Always joins as controllable follower:** Prevents Caelar Argent from joining the party when invited, even if there is a free party slot available. This option is mostly useful for players who want to solo the whole game.
