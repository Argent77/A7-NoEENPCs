        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>A mod for BG:EE, <abbr class="desc" title="Siege of Dragonspear">SoD</abbr>, BG2:EE and <abbr class="desc" title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr>.</p>
        <p>The new NPCs introduced in the Enhanced Editions differ somewhat from the original cast and might not be everyone's taste. This mod provides a number of options to adapt them to your comfort level. You can make their first appearance more passive, giving you more control over whether or when to make the first contact. A small number of events will be slightly altered to make this possible.</p>
        <p>Alternatively it is also possible to simply remove one or more NPCs from the game. In that case you have the choice to make their personal or quest-related items available to everyone in stores or as loot.</p>
        <p>Additional components allow you to improve their portraits or customize their classes and/or kits to whatever you desire. You can find more detailed information below.</p>

      <section id="compatibility">
        <h2>Compatibility</h2>
        <p>"Convenient Enhanced Edition NPCs" should be compatible with every mod out there that doesn't significantly alter the starting locations and scripts of the Enhanced Edition NPCs. At present only Pecca's mod "EE_content_tweaks" is known to interfere with this mod in BG:EE. This mod will check if it has been installed and refuses to install relevant components if detected.</p>
        <p>The mod is fully compatible with Siege of Dragonspear. However, tweak options for SoD NPCs will be more restricted because of their close involvement in the plot.</p>
        <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Version 5.0 of the mod introduces several structural changes. Do <u>not</u> install it together with earlier versions of the mod!</p>

      <section id="installation">
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <p>This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the downloaded archive into your game's installation directory (where you can find the file "chitin.key") and run <em>"setup-A7-ConvenientEENPCs.exe"</em> (Windows) or <em>"setup-A7-ConvenientEENPCs.command"</em> (macOS). Follow the instructions and you are ready to start.</p>
        <p>It is strongly recommended to start a new game after installing the mod.</p>
        <p>To uninstall, run <em>"setup-A7-ConvenientEENPCs.exe"</em> or <em>"setup-A7-ConvenientEENPCs.command"</em> again and follow the prompts.</p>
        <hr class="spacer" />
        <h3>Note for Siege of Dragonspear (SoD)</h3>
        <p>GOG and Steam both install the "Siege of Dragonspear" expansion in a way that is not moddable out of the box. You must install a mod called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation before this or any other WeiDU-based mods can be installed.</p>

        <h4>Group: Class changes</h4>
        <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
        <p>Class and kit changes are restricted to the NPC's stats, skills and abilities. They won't be reflected in their personal quests or dialogs. However, personal equipment may be updated to comply with the new class or kit requirements.</p>
        <p>For some NPCs it is possible to assign multiclass combinations. By default the interactive class selection will produce a great number of potential multiclass kit combinations to choose from. This feature can be turned off in the "A7-ConvenientEENPCs.ini" file that can be found in the mod folder.</p>
